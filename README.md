# A-B-Testing-Analysis
An A/B test is an experimentation technique used by businesses to compare two versions of a webpage, advertisement, or product feature to determine which one performs better. By randomly assigning customers or users to either the A or B version, the business can determine which version is more effective at achieving a particular goal.
